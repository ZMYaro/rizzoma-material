_⚠ Google Chrome may tell you to remove this and other “Manifest V2” extensions as part of their attempt to force adoption of “Manifest V3”.  This extension remains fully supported, but will remain on MV2 as long as possible to retain support for older Chromebooks and oppose [other issues with MV3 highlighted by the EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation)._
